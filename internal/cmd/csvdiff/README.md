# CSV DIFF

A simple program for debugging purpose to compare the difference between two **.csv** files.

We use it to compare our **.csv** file generated by **_fitconv_** with the **.csv** file generated by Official SDK's **_FitCSVTool.jar_**. The essential values should match and if it doesn't match, we can identify it.

We include example of diff on [sample-diff.txt](./sample-diff.txt). Currently, there is a different on how we interpret subfield as the main field (Dynamic Fields), the unit in our **.csv** is using "**strokes**" (from **total_strokes**) while the **.csv** official tool is using "**cycles**" (from main field: **total_cycles**). We just submit a question on garmin's forum here: [https://forums.garmin.com/developer/fit-sdk/f/discussion/355464/dynamic-fields-interpretation-and-fit-sdk-for-go](https://forums.garmin.com/developer/fit-sdk/f/discussion/355464/dynamic-fields-interpretation-and-fit-sdk-for-go), hopefully it will be anwered soon.
