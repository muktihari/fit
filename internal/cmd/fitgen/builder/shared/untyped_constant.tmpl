// Package {{ .Package }} contains untyped constants for greater flexibility, intended to simplify code typing when creating messages and fields 
// using the factory and reduce human error.
// 
// This should not be confused with typed constants in typedef. The value of these untyped constants remains the same as declared in typedef.
// The only difference is that untyped constants can take on many forms (byte, int, types.DateTime, types.File, etc.), 
//
