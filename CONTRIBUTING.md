# Contributing

Hi, thank you for showing interest in this project. I would be grateful to receive feedback and any form of help.
I hope this project can benefit fitness comunity and Go developers in particular.

This project is still in the early stages, and there may be changes to some of the APIs as it progresses.
We need more people with different use cases for the FIT SDK for Go to improve it further.

If you have trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a [pull request][prs] and mention me to review the changes.

If you plan to do major changes, here are few guidelines to follow:

1. Check the [open issues][issues] and [pull requests][prs] for existing discussions.
1. Open an [issue][issues] first, to discuss new feature or enhancement.
1. Write the code with tests, and make sure it passes locally and on CI.
1. Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).
1. After receiving feedback, squash your commits and wrap them in an informative message.

Have fun!
