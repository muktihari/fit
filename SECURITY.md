# Security Policy

We include only the essential dependencies to minimize the chance of a supply-chain attack. To minimize the risk of exposing ourselves to that vulnerability, all commits will be scanned by [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) during PR reviews, upon merging to the master branch, and on a monthly basis.

## Supported Versions

Currently, only the latest version and master branch will be supported. See [Releases](https://github.com/muktihari/fit/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability
