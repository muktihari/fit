# Fitconv

Fitconv converts FIT files to CSV format, enabling us to read the FIT data in a human-readable format. Conversely, it also converts CSV files back to FIT format, enabling us to create or edit FIT files in CSV form.

This is designed to work seamlessly with CSVs produced by the Official FIT SDK's `FitCSVTool.jar`.

Note:

- Currently, only conversions between FIT and CSV formats are supported. Other formats may be added in the future as needed or upon request.
- When converting from CSV to FIT, any unknown messages and fields are omitted due to the inability to ascertain their correct value types without additional context.

## Usage Examples

```sh
go run main.go activity.fit activity2.csv

# Output:
# ðŸ“„ "activity.fit" -> "activity.csv"
# ðŸš€ "activity2.csv" -> "activity2.fit". [Info: 2 unknown messages are skipped]

ls
# activity.fit activity.csv activity2.fit activity2.csv
```
