# Fitconv

Fitconv converts the FIT file into a CSV file, allowing us to read the FIT file in a human-readable format. And vice-versa, it converts CSV file back to FIT file allowing us editing FIT file in its CSV form using only code editor.

This is designed to work seamlessly with CSVs produced by the Official FIT SDK's `FitCSVTool.jar`.

Note:

- Currently only `FIT to CSV` conversion and vice-versa (`CSV to FIT`) are supported, other format might be added later when necessary (or requested).
- When converting `CSV to FIT`, unknown message and unknown fields are both skipped since we can't get the correct value's type since we don't have any context about it.

## Usage Examples

```sh
go run main.go activity.fit activity2.csv

# Output:
# ðŸ“„ "activity.fit" -> "activity.csv"
# ðŸš€ "activity2.csv" -> "activity2.fit". [In total, 2 unknown messages are skipped]

ls
# activity.fit activity.csv activity2.fit activity2.csv
```
