// Package filedef contains the implementation of known common file types and its listener
// to convert decoded FIT file into the desired common file type as soon as the message is decoded.
//
// TODO:
// Currently this package is still under experimental development, some functions or methods might change.
// The implementation in this package is generaly work even though we still have no proper tests.
// If you find any bug or you have an idea that you think it's better to implement it that way,
// please open an issue in github, any other form of feedback would be appreciated.
