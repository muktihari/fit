// Package profile contains all items related to Global Profile (Profile.xlsx). Some items are generated by
// "internal/cmd/fitgen" program, such as Types, Messages, and Factory for message/field creation. And rest
// of the items are added manually since the source of the items is not from Profile.xlsx file but Garmin or
// its affiliates website, such as Common File Types.
//
// The Version constant indicates the version to which this profile refers, represented by the
// value corresponding to the Official FIT SDK's version.
//
// The ProfileType defines an abstraction layer of types used in the FIT file above the base types
// (primitive-types) such as sint, uint, etc. Here is an example to help understanding it better:
//   - Type DateTime is a time representation decoded in uint32 format in the FIT binary proto.
//     The value of uint32 is a number counted since FIT Epoch (time since 31 Dec 1989 00:00:000 UTC).
//
// Using an abstraction layer like the profile type allows time to be stored in binary files as
// compact as uint32 values. This means that when we encounter a field with the DateTime type,
// we can decode it into time.Time{}.
