// Package profile defines an abstraction layer of types used in the FIT file above the base types (primitive-types) such as sint, uint, etc.
// Here is an example to help understanding it better:
//   - Type DateTime is a time representation decoded in uint32 format in the FIT binary proto. The value of uint32 is a number counted
//     since FIT Epoch (time since 31 Dec 1989 00:00:000 UTC).
//
// Using an abstraction layer like the profile type allows time to be stored in binary files as compact as uint32 values.
// This means that when we encounter a field with the DateTime type, we can decode it into time.Time{}.
